<p>Django project</p>

From: https://data-flair.training/blogs/django-project-news-aggregator-app/

<p>The news app project is a beginner and intermediate-level project. Each user create this project in a virtual setting before obtaining the news from the News API. Use Bootstrap with Tailwind to give your web app a more endaging appearance. Try Building a backend as well, though, for beginners, we recommend focusing just on the front-end part.</p>

- pip install bs4
- pip install requests
- python3 -m venv env (til at f√• hele django project med mapper frem)

Now, we will make a new Python Django project named DataFalir_NewAggregator
Then we will make new application news.
